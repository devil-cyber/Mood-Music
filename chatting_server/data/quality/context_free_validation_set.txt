Why should companies be ethical or what are the advantages of a company in behaving ethically?
Mmm, i think the whole issue of ethics is a very complex one. companies are made up of people. multinationals are made up of many different nationalities. i think that companies are part of society and as such they should reflect society's standards. companies, especially multinational ones, do have responsibilities in the world and should try to be positive influence and i think if a company is not ethical, then it will not survive as a company.
